# Spend famous peoples money

"Welcome to my 'What Could You Buy with [Rich Person's Name]' project! This is a fun meme project written in React that allows you to enter a rich person's net worth and see how much of various items you could purchase with that amount of money.

Have you ever wondered how many mansions you could buy with Elon Musk's fortune? Or how many yachts you could afford with Jeff Bezos' wealth? With this project, you can find out! Simply enter the net worth of your chosen rich person and see the results.

This project is a lighthearted way to explore the concept of wealth and the purchasing power of large sums of money. Feel free to browse through the code and try it out for yourself. Enjoy!"
